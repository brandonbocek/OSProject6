Project 6

To compile: type 'make' or 'make all'

To run: type   './oss'
			or './oss -h' for the help menu to display
			or './oss -v to turn on verbose and see more info printed'
			or './oss -l file to write to'
			or './oss -t to set the time for master to terminate'
			
deleting executables: type 'make clean'

In order to see anything and for it to run quickly verbose needs to be on.
